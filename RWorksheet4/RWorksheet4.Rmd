## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
dataShoeHeight <- data.frame(

Gender=c("F","F","F","F","M","F","F","F","M","F","M","F","M","M","M","M","F","F","M","F","F","M","M","F","M","M","M","M"),

Shoe_Size=c(6.5,9.0,8.5,8.5,10.5,7.0,9.5,9.0,13.0,7.5,10.5,8.5,12.0,10.5,13.0,11.5,8.5,5.0,10.0,6.5,7.5,8.5,10.5,8.5,10.5,11.0,9.0,13.0),

Height=c(66.0,68.0,64.5,65.0,70.0,64.0,70.0,71.0,72.0,64.0,74.5,67.0,71.0,71.0,77.0,72.0,59.0,62.0,72.0,66.0,64.0,67.0,73.0,69.0,72.0,70.0,69.0,70.0)

)
dataShoeHeight

#A Describe the data.

##This data frame contains information about individuals' gender, shoe size, and height.
#With the corresponding values for each attribute. It appears to be a small dataset with 28 data points.

#B Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.

females_subset <- dataShoeHeight[dataShoeHeight$Gender == "F", c("Gender", "Shoe_Size", "Height")]
females_subset

males_subset <- dataShoeHeight[dataShoeHeight$Gender == "M", c("Gender", "Shoe_Size", "Height")]
males_subset

#C Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.

mean_shoe_size <- mean(dataShoeHeight$Shoe_Size)
mean_height <- mean(dataShoeHeight$Height)

mean_shoe_size
mean_height

#D Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
#The connection between the two is that shoe size increases in direct proportion to height; when height is shorter, shoe size is correspondingly smaller.


#FACTORS

#2 Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector.

months <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
"September","October","September","November","August",
"January","November","November","February","May","August",
"July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")
months

factor_months_vector <- factor(months)

factor_months_vector

#3 Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Interpret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?

summaryMonths <- summary(months)
summaryMonths

summaryFactorMonths <-summary(factor_months_vector)
summaryFactorMonths

#"months_vector" provides information about the count of data points, data type, and the most frequently occurring value within the vector.
#"factor_months_vector" displays the distribution of how often each month appears.
#two types of summaries serve distinct purposes and are valuable in different situations

#4 Create a vector and factor for the table below.

factorDir <- c("East", "West", "North")
factorFreq <- c(1,4,3)
new_order_data <- factor(factorDir,levels = c("East","West","North"))
new_order_data

#5 Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv

## Error pa(to be continued hahaha)
write.csv(import_march, file = "import_march.csv")
file_path <- "/cloud/project/RWorksheet4/import_march.csv"
imported_table <- read.csv(file = "/cloud/project/RWorksheet4/import_march.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
View(imported_table)
